Note that you can playback four motion data at the same time. If you are sending one ramActor OSC message from MOTIONER or other motion capture system to RAMDanceToolkit, you can playback three motion data.


## Source code zip

If you are a developer, you can modify RAMDanceTookit source code which is placed at `RAMDanceToolkit/apps/RAMDanceToolkit`.  See also `RAMDanceToolkit/examples` and RAM API Reference on this wiki.

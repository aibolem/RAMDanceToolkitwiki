RAM Dance Toolkit is a C++ creative coding toolkit for creating environments for dancers. This toolkit contains a GUI and helpful functions for accessing, recognizing, and processing motion data to support the creation of various environmental conditions called “scenes”. The toolkit also provides realtime feedback for dancers by using code in an easy way. The toolkit uses openFrameworks, a software development toolkit for artists, meaning users can use functions from both RAM Dance Toolkit and openFrameworks. RAM Dance Toolkit will also be published as an application for Windows and Mac. As an application, users also can choreograph or rehearse with previously programmed scenes.

### RAMDanceToolkit Application

You can download the compiled application from here. 

- [RAM-app_osx_v1_1_0.zip](https://github.com/YCAMInterlab/RAMDanceToolkit/releases/download/v1.1.0/RAM-app_osx_v1_1_0.zip) (Mac OS 10.7+, 106.1MB)
- [RAM-app_win_v1_1_0.zip](https://github.com/YCAMInterlab/RAMDanceToolkit/releases/download/v1.1.0/RAM-app_win_v1_1_0.zip) (Windows 7+, 136.7MB)

### Motion Data OSC Server

The Motion Data OSC Server sends OSC messages to the RAMDanceToolkit, so you don't have to use MOTIONER or other sensors for testing. The following link includes RAMOSCServer and MotionData XML files. This application will send OSC messages to the RAMDanceToolkit when you drag and drop XML files onto the app screen. This is useful for testing the RAMDanceToolkit.

- [RAM-OSCServer_mac-v1_0_0.zip](https://github.com/YCAMInterlab/RAMDanceToolkit/releases/download/v1.0.0/RAM-OSCServer_mac-v1_0_0.zip) (Mac OS 10.7+, 32.6MB)

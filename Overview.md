 RAM Dance Toolkit is a C++ creative coding toolkit to create environments for dance. This toolkit contains a GUI and functions to access, recognize, and process motion data to support creation of various kinds of feedback to dancers using code in an easy way. Toolkit uses openFrameworks, a software development toolkit for artists, which means users can use functions from both RAM Dance Toolkit and openFrameworks. RAM Dance Toolkit will also be published as application for Windows and Mac. As an application, users also can choreograph or rehearse with previously programmed environmental conditions, which we call “scenes”.
